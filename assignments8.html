            <p>
            For this soldering assignment, I soldered a green LED along with the 1k resistor. I used a Perf-board to solder them together. 
            
            <br>

      I also chose 1k resistor for the blue LED. The voltage drop for blue LED is 3.3 V and by using the Ohm's Law which is 1.7/0.02 = 85 ohms; 1k resistor would be enough for the blue LED (if the ohms is higher than resistor then it will over burden the LED. If the resistor is too high then the flow of electricity is too low).
